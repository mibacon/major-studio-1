https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dsnys-refuse-and-recycling-disposal-networks-d0e72

which neigborhoods produces the most garbage? what are their demographics? what are the ramifications (e.g. higher temperatures, higher carbon emissions, more garbage pick up days?, etc.) and what are some conclusions to draw (less garbage pick ups? stronger recycling regulations? improve poverty levels? etc.) Can alternatives for waste management work with projections for population growth and shifts in demographics?
