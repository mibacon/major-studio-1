Q1:
Garbage Ecosystem - how does garbage flow from NYC to landfills? Who are the participants? (residential vs commercial, garbage vs recycling, etc) micro - apartments, buildings to stations, macro - stations to landfill

http://www.waste.exposed/
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dsnys-refuse-and-recycling-disposal-networks-d0e72

which neigborhoods produces the most garbage? what are their demographics? what are the ramifications (e.g. higher temperatures, higher carbon emissions, more garbage pick up days?, etc.) and what are some conclusions to draw (less garbage pick ups? stronger recycling regulations? improve poverty levels? etc.) Can alternatives for waste management work with projections for population growth and shifts in demographics?

Q2:
Interplay of changes of infrastructure and impact on NYC fauna. 

2.1 Rat Index - correlated to other factors like new buildings or other construction work?
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj/data
311 complaints

2.2 Bird Migration - has bird migration increased/decreased as a result of new buildings or added green spaces? If yes, are there specific endangered species that we could recommend new migration green spaces for? What about Unpleasant Design?

2.3 Green infrastructure and reduction of mosquito population? Green roofs apparently reduce mosquito population. Can we see this reflected in data? Did new Green Roofs lead to reduction in local mosqito sightings? if yes, can we recommend new high-risk locations to add bio-infrastructure? (CAREFUL - do green roofs cause reduction or do they just have lower % of mosquitos?)
